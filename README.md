# L2Moto

L2Moto, or Learn-to-Motorcycle is a website dedicated to providing reviews for Queensland’s Q-Ride course facilitators. Q-Ride is a competency based training and assessment program aimed at beginner motorcyclists to develop skills and confidence on the road. There are many organisations that offer the practical experience and assistance to complete the Q-Ride program, but choosing the right organisation can sometimes be a challenge. L2Moto applies online resources to help narrow down the best organisation to attend Q-Ride.
